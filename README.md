## Revolution

Revolution is an interactive HTML Server. It is radical in that:

- No stateful components, just simple, one-way functions that generate HTML.
- Structured Concurrency and Effects drive the UI, not the other way around.
- Middleware that can transform HTML at the AST level.
- "Server Side Rendering" is trivial because HTML generation is one-way.
   Essentially just calling a template
- Composability at the website level.
